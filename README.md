# Hi there — I’m Nandika Tsendbazar

I work at the intersection of **Earth Observation (EO) based land dynamics and uncertainty assessment**. My research focuses on making EO-based products more reliable, understandable, and useful.

## What I do
- **Monitor land dynamics** — land cover, vegetation, wetlands, and land degradation, using multi-source satellite data, time-series analysis, and machine learning.  
- **Assess uncertainty in EO maps** —  independent statistical validation, local uncertainty metrics, map comparability analysis, and studies of how well maps serve different purposes, applying statistics, geostatistics, and machine learning.  

## Where I’ve contributed
- Developed and implemented **operational validation frameworks** for global land cover maps, including:  
  - [Copernicus Global Land Service Dynamic Land Cover (JRC)](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/)  
  - [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en)
- Applied this framework to validate **JRC- Global Forest Cover 2020 map** and to compare other commonly used [global land cover maps](https://landcarbonlab.org/insights/global-land-cover-maps-accuracy-applications/). 
- Active member of **[CEOS Land Product Validation (LPV)](https://lpvs.gsfc.nasa.gov/)**, focusing on land cover, land cover change, and area estimation.  

## What drives my work
I aim to turn EO data into information that scientists, policymakers, and environmental managers can truly trust and use. Better maps mean better decisions about our changing planet.
